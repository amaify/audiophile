The admin store was built using [keystone JS](https://keystonejs.com/) a powerful NodeJS powered Headless CMS. To add/edit items in the admin store you should:

- Visit https://audiophile-admin.onrender.com/signin then;
  > Enter the following login details
  >
  > email: test@test.com
  > password: test1234

The client side was build using NextJS 14 App router. It's a basic application where users can:

- Add/remove items from cart.
- make payment to the store via `stripe`
- Receive emails after a successful transaction.
  > The received emails are in two categories:
  > - Card payment: Users will get a confirmation of their order that contains the order summary and it lets them know their order is on the way.
  > - Cash payment: Users will receive a confirmation of their order, informing them that the order will be shipped after payment is confirmed.
